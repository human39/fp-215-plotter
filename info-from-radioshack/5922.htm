In GRAPHIC MODE, press ON/OFF LINE while all of the four position switches
(up, down, right, and left arrows) are being pressed. The plotter will plot
a test pattern which checks stored instructions for plotting.

After completing the plotting, the pen returns to its Home position. When
the ON/OFF LINE switch is pressed, this mode is canceled and the Plotter
switches to the GRAPHIC Mode.

Do not press the PEN UP/DOWN switch or ON/OFF LINE switch during the
SELF-TEST mode.
