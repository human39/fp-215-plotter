FP 215   (26-1193)                Print Mode             Faxback Doc. 5921

In the Print mode, you can use your Plotter like an ordinary printer either
by hardware or software commands.  To enter Print mode via hardware,
power-up the Plotter and simultaneously press &#60; and &#62; for horizontal format
printing (PRINT-A Mode).  To do so via software, send a CHR$(17).  By
turning PRINT-A Mode, the pen will move from starting position to the
coordinate position (255,1650) and will print in the PRINT-A Mode according
to the input character code.

In the PRINT-A Mode a character size of 2.4mm x 1.6mm, 92 characters per
line and 36 lines per page can be printed.

NOTE:
1. When the last character of the last line has been printed, the Plotter
   stops printing.  To change the paper, press the ON/OFF LINE switch.  Pen
   will move to Home position.

   Press ON/OFF LINE again after changing paper, then Plotter will restart
   printing from beginning of new paper.

2. When printing is finished, press ON/OFF LINE.  The pen will move to Home
   position.  If you wish to print some more, press ON/OFF LINE again.  The
   pen will move from Home position to the first designated position and
   wait for data.

3. When the Power Switch is turned off, PRINT-A Mode is canceled.

4. To stop printing, press the ON/OFF LINE after the input signal has
   stopped.

5. To enter GRAPHIC Mode, send a decimal code 19 to the Plotter.  From
   BASIC, use the command CHR$(19).

CHR$(18).  By turning PRINT-B Mode, the pen will move from starting
position to the coordinate position (260,250) and will print in the PRINT-B
Mode according to the input character code.

In the PRINT-B Mode a character size of 2.4mm x 1.6mm, 64 characters per
